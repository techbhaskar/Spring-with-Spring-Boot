# Spring with Spring Boot
# Introduction
Spring framework is the widely held and light weight framework available in the market right now.
Itâ€™s open source java platform, comprising of core features like Dependency injection, Spring MVC, Spring DAO and Spring Security etc.
# Benefits

	1)	Develops enterprise class applications with simple POJOs, the benefit of using POJOs is no need of EJB container from the application servers, we can achieve with this simple web servers like tomcat.
	2)	Spring framework contains predefined components which we can plug and play like JDBC, JPA and Hibernate etc.
	3)	Loosing coupling because of the dependency injection.
	4)	We can test the spring application easily because of its POJO style objects.
	5)	We can easily handle any exceptions into our own defined exceptions.
	6)	It has the light weight IoC container because if this we can build light weight applications.
	7)	Provides api to handle transaction management interfaces.
# Spring modules
